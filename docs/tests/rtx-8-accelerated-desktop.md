# Tests RTX-8 – : the RTX composites, the Intel panel shows it (accelerated desktop)

> **Summary.** The RTX path resumed on 2026-10-16 as the shortest way to an accelerated desktop (decision with Lukas;
> Intel Metal, path A of [../status.md](../status.md), waits until this works). RTX-8 tests one change: NMIntelFB in
> an `IOFBController` of its own (intelfb-0009) instead of index 4 of NVRM's group, where `fFbs[0]` was NULL because
> no NVRMFB head ever starts on this laptop.

Setup as in [rtx-1-7-nmintelfb.md](rtx-1-7-nmintelfb.md): Intel test driver **off** (no `nmxintel=1`),
`tools/intelfb/install.sh`, then at run time `tools/intelfb/enable.sh` (`debug.nvaccel_igpu=1`, `debug.nvaccelfb=3`)
and a WindowServer restart. NVRAM `nullmoth-intelfb-delay=45` kept from RTX-7 (same conditions, one variable).

## Evidence before RTX-8 (2026-10-16, Intel test driver on)
- [measured, ioreg] NVRM `nvrm-display = "heads 0x0 accel 0 …"`; four `NVRMDisplay` nubs (`fb-index` 0–3), index 0
  with `connected-displays = 0`, none with an NVRMFB child.
- [measured, IOGraphics `IOFramebuffer.cpp`] `open()`: `controller->fFbs[IOFBDependentIndex] = this`;
  `FOREACH_FRAMEBUFFER` stops at the first NULL; `kIOFBWSStartAttribute` reads `fFbs[0]->messaged`.
- [measured, NVAccel `nvrm-accel.cpp`] `fbPublished` takes the head number from `IOFBDependentIndex` once, at first
  publish; frames reach a CPU-only scan-out (NMIntelFB) by copy, decided by `kva && !phys`, not by the index.
- [measured, `IOFramebuffer::probeAccelerator`] the accelerator is found by walking the PCI device's children; the
  dependent ID plays no part.

### intelfb-0009
Own `IOFBDependentID 0x4E4D494E00000001`, `IOFBDependentIndex 4` before `IOFramebuffer::start` (NVAccel → head 4);
`open()` override sets the index to 0 before `IOFramebuffer::open`. Trail `dep-own` (or `dep-nvrm` with
`nullmoth-intelfb-dep=2`), `open-idx0`. [unverified] NVAccel must see the publish before WindowServer opens the
panel; the 45 s delay keeps that order. `NMIntelFB ca82df9d…`.

Also: `tools/mirror` fixed (it never ran: launchd EX_CONFIG, see pitfalls) and now also acts when `NMIntelFB` exists.

## RTX-8 — intelfb-0009 (pending)
